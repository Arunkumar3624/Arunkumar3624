👋 Hi, I'm Arunkumar
Full-Stack Developer | Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner

Arunkumar – Full-Stack Developer (React, Node, Django,Python/Java)

I build production-grade web applications focused on performance, reliability, and real-world usage. 
My work includes designing REST APIs, implementing authentication systems, and developing scalable frontend interfaces used in learning and content-driven platforms.

I have built and deployed full-stack systems such as a Learning Management System and a digital notes platform, implementing role-based access control, secure authentication, and database-driven content management. 
My projects are designed with clean architecture, modular APIs, and maintainable codebases rather than one-off demos.

I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript on the frontend with React and Next.js, and backend systems using Node.js and Django, backed by MySQL and PostgreSQL. 
I use Git, Postman, and Docker to build, test, and ship applications in a structured, professional workflow.

My goal is to work on real production systems where performance, scalability, and clean design matter
